## Challenge Overview
Assist Seth and Tom with an audit of the election.  Originally information that was submitted was to best automate the results for efficiency.   Once the initial round of audit was done, there was an additional request to complete the audit.   It was important to see the Countyï¿½s that participated.   It was also doing a deep dive into the total votes and the percentages that were made of the total votes to get an understand of which counties actively participated.
